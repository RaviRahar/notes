### Regular Languages, Finite Automata and Regular Expressions

- - Regular Languages are closed on \*(kleene's closure), union(alternation), concatenation, complementation
  - Proving: RE can be converted to FA (considering base cases and then Closures)
  - Proving: NFA = DFA (by thinking of power set)
  - Proving: GNFA = NFA (by induction)
  - Proving: FA can be converted to RE (Using GFA)
  - NFA: many worlds and crystall ball interpretations
  - Regular Pumping Lemma

- - Kleene's Theorem: Equivalence of RE and FA
  - Epsilon closure
  - RE ==Thompson's-Construction==> NFA ==Subset-Construction==> DFA ==Minizing-DFA==> ==Transition-Matrix==> Code

  - Limits of FA: Cannot do recursions

  - RE (Stephen Kleene, 1950)

### Context Free Grammer and Push Down Automata

- - Proving: Conversion of CFG to PDA (proved using replacement of terminal symbol on top of stack)
  - Proving: Conversion of PDA to CFG (not proved)
  - CF Pumping Lemma
  - FA are just PDA but without stack

- - Ambiguous Grammars

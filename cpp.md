### Topics that I know, but don't have time to write:

- Abstract Classes: Vtable
- Templates
- RAII (Resource Allocation Is Initialisation): Constructor/Destructors
- Friend Functions
- Initializing in constructor in C: using `Constructor():first_value(3), second_value(8){}`
- Vectors and Hashmaps
- How memory is assigned to objects and memory padding and alignment

This is all I know for now in C++.
